Hello, my name is Vasiliy Buriy. Now you see my test task fo UKAD company (Single Page Application).  

(before starting, make sure you have the Node.js installed)

When you download project from GitHub, you should open this folder in console. 
After that write a comand "npm install" (you install all files need for run program)
Ok, next step is write a comand "npm start" (you start React services and other technologies from my project)
That's all) Enjoy your use.


My project has a simple architecture. Two important folders: src and public.
Src has three folder:
1) AtionAPI has a code for conection whith server.
2) Components has all components which can we see, like Header, Section, Carusel, Footer etc.
3) Images has only 1 pictures. It is logo our website.
Public has a multiple files:
1) index.html with root-file and font links 
2) reset.css which reset default css styles from browser
3) fovicon.ico for render a small picture in tab.
